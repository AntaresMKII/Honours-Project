\chapter{Introduction}

Cooperation among different individuals in a group is often necessary to solve complex problems
that are otherwise harder or impossible to complete for a singular individual. This concept is
true in the field of robotics, where robotic swarms systems, which are systems composed of
numerous small and limited robots \autocite{HO17}, are a crucial area of study. Due to the early
stage of development of this field, there are not many currently existing applications, however
there exists many research projects to test the capabilities of swarm algorithms \autocite{MS20}.
Despite the lack of representation in the industry sector, multi-robot systems have become of
interest recently due to their abilities to resist failures and damages, adaptability to new
environments and low costs \autocite{HO17}.


A specific problem in swarm robotics, is the pattern formation problem, which consists of
"getting a group of robots to form and stay in a specific formation, like a wedge or a chain,
and maintaining that formation" \autocite{LS22}. The robots in the swarm need to coordinate
to maintain a specific shape in order to achieve the desired goal. In this process, different
methods of controlling the swarm can be used, for example the election of a leader or the 
imposition of a certain set of behaviors for each member. There is also a 
distinction between centralized and decentralized pattern formation, where centralized pattern
formation is performed when there exists a centralized unit that coordinates the individual
robots \autocite{HO17}.
