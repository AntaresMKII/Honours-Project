===== Automatic Movement using GNSS =====

Webots assumes that the world is flat.
No need to account for earth curvature

- Goal:
A set of coordinates in the world that
the drone needs to reach

- Flight path:
The flight path is relativelt easy to
calculate. The distance between
the drone and the goal can be
computed using Euclidian Distance.

Distance d: Euclidian Distance
Heading: The heading is the angle
between the distance and the
north. It can be computed using
trigonometry
alpha = cos^-1(adj/dist)
adj = length of NS coordinates

- How to turn?
Apply a yaw motion until compass
reads the correct heading. Find
the correct way to turn using
subtraction of curr heading and
desired heading

- How to move?
Apply pitch to move forward
account for possible momentum
