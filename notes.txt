===== Automatic Movement using GNSS =====

Webots assumes that the world is flat.
No need to account for earth curvature

- Goal:
A set of coordinates in the world that
the drone needs to reach

- Flight path:
The flight path is relativelt easy to
calculate. The distance between
the drone and the goal can be
computed using Euclidian Distance.

Distance d: Euclidian Distance
Heading: The heading is the angle
between the distance and the
north. It can be computed using
trigonometry
alpha = cos^-1(adj/dist)
adj = length of NS coordinates

- How to turn?
Apply a yaw motion until compass
reads the correct heading. Find
the correct way to turn using
subtraction of curr heading and
desired heading

- How to move?
Apply pitch to move forward
account for possible momentum

== ISSUES ==
Talk about the bug you found in the doc of Webots

== Formation ==
Early apporach of having leader compute the path to take and communicate to the followers where they should position themselves

More decentralized approach
- followers position is communicated to leader
- leader computes angle and distance and sends this info to the followers
- leaders computes path to take
- communicates one waypoint at a time to followers
- followers compute their position relative to this point

An even better approach
Predefined shape that is rotated and translated assuming the leader position to be at (0,0)
- Translation, simply use leader position
- Rotation:
	let a be the angle of the shape
	- if leader is facing +x then a = 0
	- if leader is facing -x then a = pi
	- if leader is facing +y then a = 0.5 pi
	- if leader is facing -y then a = -0.5 pi
	- if we are at an angle because we are traversing a cell from fds then add 0.25 pi to one of the previous angles
