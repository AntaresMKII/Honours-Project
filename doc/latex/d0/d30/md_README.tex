 This project showcases the formation flight of a group of unmanned aerial vehicles avoiding obstacles while navigating and maintaining the formation. This project uses Cyberbotic\textquotesingle{}s Webots to simulate the drones and physics.

The project is my Honours Project for the Bachelor of Computer Science Honours at Carleton University.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Dependencies}{Dependencies}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
The project consists of controllers and example worlds for Cyberbotic\textquotesingle{}s Webots, so, in order for the project to work, you will need to download Webots. You can find the latest release on their \href{https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub repository}}.

To compile the report you will need La\+TeX as well as Inkscape for the SVG images.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
To see the progress so far import the project directory into Webots and open the {\ttfamily obstacle\+\_\+avoidance\+\_\+test.\+wbt} world file. Then compile the {\ttfamily uav\+\_\+controller} controller and run the simulation.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Gallery}{Gallery}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
