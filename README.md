# Formation Flight of UAV Swarms in an Obstacle Filled Three-Dimensional Environment

This project showcases the formation flight of a group of unmanned aerial vehicles
avoiding obstacles while navigating and maintaining the formation. This project
uses Cyberbotic's Webots to simulate the drones and physics.

The project is my Honours Project for the Bachelor of Computer Science Honours at
Carleton University.

## Dependencies

The project consists of controllers and example worlds for Cyberbotic's
Webots, so, in order for the project to work, you will need to download
Webots. You can find the latest release on their
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots).

To compile the report you will need LaTeX as well as Inkscape for the SVG
images.

## Usage

To see the progress so far import the project directory into Webots
and open the `obstacle_avoidance_test.wbt` world file. Then compile the `uav_controller`
controller and run the simulation.
